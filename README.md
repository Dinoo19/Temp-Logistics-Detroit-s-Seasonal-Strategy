# Temp-Logistics-Detroit-s-Seasonal-Strategy
This project uses Random Forest, LSTM, and GRU models to predict Detroit’s monthly extreme temperatures. Accurate forecasts help enhance logistics efficiency, route optimization, vehicle maintenance, and cargo safety. The GRU model achieved the best performance with an R² of 0.91.
